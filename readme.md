# Quiz Web App

This repo/app is a starting point for a quiz web app that can be built using Copilot's assistance. The goal was to create a simple quiz game with multiple-choice questions and a scoring system. The app will have a game over screen that displays the final score after all rounds are completed. It can be further enhanced with features like a timer, progress bar, categories, levels, user authentication, leaderboard, sound effects, hints, lifelines, multiplayer mode, question feedback, mobile responsiveness, and social sharing. Check out the steps below to build a feature-rich quiz web app.

## Game Rules
